# Claude Instructions

@AGENTS.md

This repository uses canonical LRA governance by pointer, not by copied rules.

Repository: `lra-volume-viii`
Canonical repo overlay: `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-volume.md`
Canonical route resolver:
`python <governance-root>/capabilities/resolve.py --repo lra-volume-viii --task "<user task>" --root <repo-root>`
Human route index (lazy reference only): `docs/agent-task-index.md`

Resolve canonical governance in this order:

1. `LRA_GOVERNANCE_ROOT`;
2. sibling `../lra-governance`;
3. an explicit `lra-governance` checkout supplied by the build image or task.

If canonical governance cannot be resolved, stop and report that
`lra-governance` is not present.

If import semantics are unavailable, follow `AGENTS.md` in this repository as
the local pointer wrapper, then run the resolver. Do not treat this file as a
local source of truth.

Provider note: Claude should import or follow `AGENTS.md`, then follow canonical governance.
