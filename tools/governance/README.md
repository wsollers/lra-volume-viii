# Governance Tools

This directory contains the canonical implementations of governance generation,
sync, validation, drift-check, and task-scope audit tools.

Leaf repositories may carry wrapper scripts with matching paths, but those
wrappers must delegate back here. They must not copy or fork the implementation.
If a wrapper cannot locate `lra-governance`, it should fail with a clear error
message such as "lra-governance is not present" and should not silently skip the
required check.

Available and planned tools:

- `audit_latex_decoration.py` - inventory-only scanner for volume theorem and
  definition decoration compliance.
- `audit_proof_layout.py` - deterministic scanner for proof file layout,
  proof-stub status, topic-mirrored proof folders, and proof index reachability.
- `audit_volume_layout.py` - deterministic scanner for volume, chapter, topic,
  and router layout.
- `generate_agent_wrappers.py`
- `merge_repo_overlays.py`
- `report_wrapper_drift.py` - read-only comparison tool for generated wrapper
  previews versus downstream files.
- `sync_agent_wrappers.py` - guarded wrapper sync tool; dry-run by default,
  requires explicit repo selection, and write mode is not used until a pilot is
  approved.
- `validate_chapter_house_rules.py` - chapter-scoped acceptance validator for
  current LRA house rules.
- `validate_volume.py` - integrated volume validator for current LRA house
  rules and volume acceptance.
- `validate_repo_rules.py`
- `audit_task_scope.py`
- `dry_run_sync.py`
- `sync_governance.py`

## Requirements

Future tools must support dry-run operation before writing downstream files.
They must refuse to touch `Learning-Real-Analysis/scripts/` and must not print
secret values.

## Proof Layout Audit

Run from `lra-governance` against a leaf repo, volume, chapter, or section.
If the target name is not obvious, discover the available targets first:

```powershell
python tools\governance\audit_proof_layout.py --root F:\repos\lra-volume-ii --list-targets
python tools\governance\audit_proof_layout.py --root F:\repos\lra-volume-ii --chapter whole-numbers --section extending-addition --strict
```

Use `--strict` when the target is expected to satisfy the current
topic-mirrored proof architecture. Use `--format json` for machine-readable
reports.

## Volume Layout Audit

Run from `lra-governance` against a leaf repo, volume, chapter, or section.
Section scope audits the containing chapter, because topic routing and
notes/proofs pairing are chapter-level invariants:

```powershell
python tools\governance\audit_volume_layout.py --root F:\repos\lra-volume-ii --chapter whole-numbers --strict
```

Use `--strict` when the target is expected to satisfy the current
volume/chapter/topic architecture. Use `--format json` for machine-readable
reports.

## Volume Validation

Run from `lra-governance` against the target leaf volume repository:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_volume.py F:\repos\lra-volume-ii --fail-on-errors
```

Use scoped audit tools such as `audit_proof_layout.py` and
`audit_volume_layout.py` only when a task needs a focused report.

## Chapter House-Rule Validation

Run from `lra-governance` against a single chapter root when a chapter is
expected to satisfy current house rules:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_chapter_house_rules.py --chapter F:\repos\lra-volume-i\volume-i\propositional-logic
```

Use `--format json` for machine-readable reports. The validator is intentionally
strict: it checks chapter routing, capstone presence, breadcrumb and roadmap
structure, note/proof/exercise router structure, notes/proofs topic pairing,
Toolkit boxes, prose block discipline, formal block decoration and order,
dependency references, proof navigation, proof-file layers, labels, exercise
routing, capstone structure, reference-voice discipline in remark/example/
exposition blocks, LaTeX structural balance, generated artifact boundaries,
index ordering, proof stub/full TODO placement, box discipline, source
crosswalk citations, exercise-ledger consistency, predicate/relation review
warnings, and offline figure rules.

The notes/proofs topic-pairing rule allows `notes/notation` as a notes-only
topic, since notation ledgers are expected in notation-heavy chapters and do
not require mirrored proof folders.

Voice validation rejects classroom, workbook, motivational, and direct-address
prose in `remark*`, `example*`, and `exposition` blocks. Examples include
first-person plural wording (`we`, `us`, `our`), direct reader address (`you`,
`your`), and classroom roles (`student`, `reader`, `learner`, `instructor`,
`course`, `lecture`, `homework`). Use impersonal reference prose instead.

For proof files, the validator checks that each file has exactly one proof
label before all environments, exactly one `\LRAProofFor{...}` association,
correct return navigation, the correct starred theorem-like restatement type,
one professional proof layer marker, one detailed learning/instructional proof
layer marker, a proof-structure remark, dependencies with statement-target
hyperrefs or `\NoLocalDependencies`, no labels inside restatement/proof
environments, and terminal `\clearpage`.

Normal validation is read-only. To create the standardized planned capstone
stub when `proofs/exercises/capstone-{chapter}.tex` is missing, run:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_chapter_house_rules.py --chapter F:\repos\lra-volume-i\volume-i\propositional-logic --generate-missing-capstone
```

The generator writes a compile-safe placeholder only. It does not invent the
mathematical capstone problem.

Predicate/relation scanning reports unknown `\operatorname{...}` terms as
warnings rather than errors. Those warnings require author guidance: the term
may be a legitimate new predicate/relation that should be added to canonical
YAML, or it may be an invented/unreviewed symbol that should be removed.

### Schema Coverage Rule

The chapter house-rule validator is the deterministic acceptance gate for
chapter-local requirements from:

- `constitution/schema/file-schema.yaml`;
- `constitution/schema/block-registry.yaml`;
- `constitution/schema/artifact-matrix.yaml`.

When those schema files change, the same change must update this validator or
document why a requirement is handled by another deterministic tool. Repo-wide
requirements such as monorepo root shape, volume repository root shape,
canonical YAML locations, and source-of-truth repository roles are outside the
chapter validator and belong to repo/layout audits. Semantic requirements such
as whether a capstone truly avoids later chapter material require source or
knowledge-graph audits in addition to this structural validator.
