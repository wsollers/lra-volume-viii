# Agent Instructions

## Global Agent Rules

- Treat generated instruction files as derived artifacts.
- Canonical governance, workflows, validators, schemas, prompts, and shared
  scripts live in `../lra-governance`, or `F:/repos/lra-governance` on the
  local Windows checkout. Use `LRA_GOVERNANCE_ROOT` when the checkout is
  elsewhere.
- Do not expect governance files or `common/` to be synced into this repo.
  Build workflows should obtain `lra-governance` and `lra-common` directly,
  normally through the Docker image or explicit checkouts.
- Follow the owning repository boundary for every task.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, tokens, or machine-local private values.
- Do not modify mathematical content during governance or wrapper-generation tasks.
- Do not touch `Learning-Real-Analysis/scripts/`.
- Port emergency downstream instruction repairs back to `lra-governance`.

## Repo Overlay

# Learning-Real-Analysis Overlay

Stub overlay for the monorepo integration hub.

Owned concerns:

- assembled monorepo integration,
- omnibus builds,
- canonical predicate / notation / relation YAML files,
- cross-volume extraction integration,
- sync receiver behavior.

Do not touch the intentionally untracked `scripts/` directory as part of this
governance migration.

## Agent Scope

Agents working here may coordinate across integrated content, canonical YAML,
and extraction dispatch, but must not treat downstream synced copies as their
own source of truth.

Canonical YAML edits are allowed only when the task explicitly targets
`predicates.yaml`, `notation.yaml`, or `relations.yaml`.

## Provider Notes

Codex reads this file as the local agent entrypoint.
